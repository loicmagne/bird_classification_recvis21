# MVA RecVis 2021 Bird images classification competition

This is my work for the [2021 Kaggle competition on bird classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/mva-recvis-2021/leaderboard) of the Object Recognition and Computer Vision class. I finetuned [BEiT](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/beit.html) vision transformer with the HuggingFace library and heavy augmentations. Data were preprocessed using [YoloV5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5). This got me 3rd out of 164 participants, with public leaderboard accuracy of 92.9% and private leaderboard accuracy of 91.7%.
